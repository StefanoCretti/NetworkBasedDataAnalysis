  abstract = {Among proteomics technologies, protein microarray, over the past last years, has gained an increased momentum in the biomarkers discovery domain. The characteristics of protein microarray, namely that it is a high-throughput tool, it provides a high specificity and only requires a minute amount of biological samples, render it a suitable tool for searching, quantifying and validating biomarkers in various pathologies. Protein microarray is based on the specific antigen-antibody reaction, such as any enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the specific reaction occurring on a miniaturized support (chip or slide), thus having the advantage of simultaneous evaluation of tens to thousands of molecules in small samples with a highly specific recognition for the detection system. In this review, we highlight the history of protein microarray technologies development and discuss this technology is stepping into the future. We present personalized medicine goals and discuss how protein microarray can aid in these goals, with an emphasis on several oncological diseases. We also discuss how protein technology has been used in diseases, such as lung, breast cancers, as well as in other diseases that, over the past last years, have taken advantage of this proteomic endeavor.},

  abstract = {Normalization means to adjust microarray data for effects which arise from variation in the technology rather than from biological differences between the RNA samples or between the printed probes. This paper describes normalization methods based on the fact that dye balance typically varies with spot intensity and with spatial position on the array. Print-tip loess normalization provides a well-tested general purpose normalization method which has given good results on a wide range of arrays. The method may be refined by using quality weights for individual spots. The method is best combined with diagnostic plots of the data which display the spatial and intensity trends. When diagnostic plots show that biases still remain in the data after normalization, further normalization steps such as plate-order normalization or scale-normalization between the arrays may be undertaken. Composite normalization may be used when control spots are available which are known to be not differentially expressed. Variations on loess normalization include global loess normalization and two-dimensional normalization. Detailed commands are given to implement the normalization techniques using freely available software.},
